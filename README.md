# Snake Game (Python)

A classic **Snake Game** implemented in **Python**, designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as game loops, keyboard input handling, collision detection, and basic graphics rendering.

This project is beginner-friendly and ideal for learning how simple games work under the hood using Python.

---

## 🎮 Project Overview

The Snake Game is a timeless arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food.  
The objective is to **survive as long as possible** without colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body.

This implementation focuses on:
- Clean logic
- Readable code
- Core gameplay mechanics

---

## ✨ Features

- Smooth snake movement  
- Food generation and score tracking  
- Collision detection (walls & self)  
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows  
- Simple and intuitive controls  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python, Turtle Graphics, Keyboard Input Handling, Game Loop Logic

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python **3.7+**
- Built‑in Python libraries only (no external dependencies)

If `turtle` is not installed (rare):
```bash
pip install turtle
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gopal00NIraula/SnakeGamePy.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd SnakeGamePy
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

*(Replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different.)*

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|----|--------|
| ↑ | Move Up |
| ↓ | Move Down |
| ← | Move Left |
| → | Move Right |

---

## 📊 Game Rules

- The snake grows longer when it eats food  
- Hitting the wall ends the game  
- Colliding with your own body ends the game  
- The score increases with each food item eaten  

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

This project helps you understand:
- Game loops and real-time updates  
- Event-driven programming  
- Collision detection logic  
- Modular Python coding practices
